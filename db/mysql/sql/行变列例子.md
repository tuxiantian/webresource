### 行变列例子
```sql
USE csdn;  
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS csdn.tb;  
CREATE TABLE tb(`cname` VARCHAR(10),cource VARCHAR(10),score INT) ENGINE=INNODB;  
  
INSERT INTO tb VALUES('张三','语文',74);  
INSERT INTO tb VALUES('张三','数学',83);  
INSERT INTO tb VALUES('张三','物理',93);  
INSERT INTO tb VALUES('李四','语文',74);  
INSERT INTO tb VALUES('李四','数学',84);  
INSERT INTO tb VALUES('李四','物理',94);  
  
SELECT * FROM tb;  
```
需要得到的结果是：
| 姓名         | 语文  | 数学  | 物理  | 总成绩 | 平均成绩 |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ | -------- |
| 张三         | 74.00 | 83.00 | 93.00 | 250.00 | 83.33    |
| 李四         | 74.00 | 84.00 | 94.00 | 252.00 | 84.00    |
| 总成绩平均数 | 74.00 | 83.50 | 93.50 | 251.00 | 83.67    |
#### 解决方法一
```sql
SELECT cname AS "姓名",  
    SUM(IF(cource="语文",score,0)) AS "语文",  
    SUM(IF(cource="数学",score,0)) AS "数学",  
    SUM(IF(cource="物理",score,0)) AS "物理",  
    SUM(score) AS "总成绩",  
    ROUND(AVG(score),2) AS "平均成绩"  
FROM tb   
GROUP BY cname  
UNION ALL  
SELECT  
    "总成绩平均数",  
    ROUND(AVG(`语文`),2) , ROUND(AVG(`数学`),2), ROUND(AVG(`物理`),2), ROUND(AVG(`总成绩`),2), ROUND(AVG(`平均成绩`),2)  
FROM(  
    SELECT "all",cname AS "姓名",  
        SUM(IF(cource="语文",score,0)) AS "语文",  
        SUM(IF(cource="数学",score,0)) AS "数学",  
        SUM(IF(cource="物理",score,0)) AS "物理",  
        SUM(score) AS "总成绩",  
        AVG(score) AS "平均成绩"  
    FROM tb   
    GROUP BY cname  
)tb2   
GROUP BY tb2.all;  
```
#### 解决方法二
```sql
SELECT   
    cname AS "姓名",  
    MAX(CASE cource WHEN "语文" THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS "语文",   
    MAX(CASE cource WHEN "数学" THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS "数学",   
    MAX(CASE cource WHEN "物理" THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS "物理",   
    SUM(score) AS "总成绩",  
    ROUND(AVG(score) ,2) AS "平均成绩"  
FROM tb   
GROUP BY `cname`  
UNION ALL  
SELECT  
    "总成绩平均数",  
    ROUND(AVG(`语文`),2) , ROUND(AVG(`数学`),2), ROUND(AVG(`物理`),2), ROUND(AVG(`总成绩`),2), ROUND(AVG(`平均成绩`),2)  
FROM(   SELECT 'all' ,    
        cname AS "姓名",  
        MAX(CASE cource WHEN "语文" THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS "语文",   
        MAX(CASE cource WHEN "数学" THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS "数学",   
        MAX(CASE cource WHEN "物理" THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS "物理",   
        SUM(score) AS "总成绩",  
        ROUND(AVG(score) ,2) AS "平均成绩"  
    FROM tb   
    GROUP BY `cname`   
)tb2 GROUP BY tb2.all
