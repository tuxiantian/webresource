### Footnotes

GitBook supports a simple syntax for such footnotes. Footnotes are relative to each pages.

```
Text prior to footnote reference.[^2]

[^2]: Comment to include in footnote.
```

### References

There is another way to create links which does not interrupt the text flow. The URL and title are defined using a reference name and this reference name is then used in square brackets instead of the link URL:

```
This is [an example][id] reference-style link.
```

Then, anywhere in the document, you define your link label like this, on a line by itself:

```
[id]: http://example.com/  "Optional Title Here"
```
